**Linting, Testing, and Building Tools**
- **Linting**: Tools like `pylint` and `flake8` are commonly used. They help enforce coding standards and catch errors.
- **Testing**: `pytest` is a go-to choice. It's a full-featured testing tool that supports unit tests, functional tests, and more.
- **Building**: For building and packaging Python applications, `setuptools` and `wheel` are standard tools.

**CI/CD Alternatives**
There are several alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions for setting up CI/CD. Some popular ones include:
- GitLab CI/CD
- Travis CI
- CircleCI
- Bitbucket Pipelines

These tools offer various features and integrations, so the choice often depends on the specific needs of the project.

**Self-hosted vs Cloud-based Environment**
Choosing between a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment depends on several factors:
- A self-hosted environment might be better if you have specific hardware requirements, need to maintain high security standards, or want more control over your CI/CD environment.
- A cloud-based environment might be more suitable if you want to avoid the overhead of managing and maintaining servers, or if you need to scale up and down quickly.
